- *Energy supply and propulsion system block diagram:
	- [Attach](attachments/ecomaua_energy_supply_propulsion_system_description_2025_prototype.pdf)
- *Describe the design of the energy supply and propulsion system:
	- Energy supply description:
		- The vehicle's energy comes from a single custom-built Li-Ion battery pack. The battery is built in a 6S1P configuration (22.2 V, 2.5 Ah). The pack has an internal Battery Management System (BMS), which provides over-current and over-temperature protection. During regular operation, the maximum expected current is 15A, and the vehicle's entire protection system is designed around this value. Standard 2.5 mm² gauge electrical wire is used for the battery's electrical wiring.
		- An automotive fuse, external to the battery, can halt all energy supplied by the battery when triggered. After the fuse, the power passes through two Normally Closed (NC) emergency switches, connected in series. These include one external switch and one internal switch that the driver can access. If either of the two emergency switches is activated, all battery power to the vehicle is immediately cut off.
		- Following the emergency switches, the power is distributed throughout the vehicle as needed. The motor controller, horn, vehicle telemetry, and other electronic systems are connected in parallel and act as the load for the battery.
		- The motor controller is the only means for the brushed DC motor to receive power. It can detect abnormal situations, such as over-current scenarios, and can stop the motor if necessary. The driver provides the desired speed input through a spring-loaded throttle. This setup acts as a dead man's safety device, ensuring the motor will halt if the driver is not actively managing the vehicle's speed.
	- Propulsion system description:
		- The entire vehicle's propulsion is provided by a 24V, 200W brushed DC motor. This motor is connected to a reduction system composed of two toothed belt pulleys. The final belt pulley is connected to an manually controlled motor coupling system (controlled by the pilot), which then connects to a standard freewheel mechanism that links the assembly to the traction rear wheel. This motor coupling system allows the traction rear wheel to be either connected to the electric motor or completely free. The freewheel mechanism ensures that the motor propels the vehicle forward but not in reverse. Additionally, it allows the vehicle to be manually pushed forward without the motor adding any extra mechanical resistance, even when coupled.
		- The vehicle's two front wheels do not incorporate any kind of traction device.

- *PERSERVERANCE: What challenges has your Shell Eco-marathon team faced in your local communities/team? How have you persevered and ultimately succeeded?
	- The Eco Mauá team faced significant challenges leading up to the Shell Eco-marathon, experiencing a major mechanical setback when a critical component of their vehicle unexpectedly failed, forcing them to quickly rethink their strategy. Despite having many new members still gaining experience, the team embraced the challenge and constructed a completely new prototype from the ground up, seeking support from former members, advisors, and other student teams at Instituto Mauá de Tecnologia. Through this collective effort, the team successfully introduced innovative design solutions and new construction techniques focused on maximizing efficiency. Their perseverance paid off in 2024 when they achieved their first official score at the Shell Eco-marathon Brazil, an accomplishment even more remarkable as they simultaneously refined their existing Prototype vehicle and built their first-ever Urban Concept vehicle. These experiences underscore the team's resilience, adaptability, and ability to transform setbacks into valuable opportunities for learning, innovation, and success.
	
- *COLLABORATION: What sustainability challenges have you observed in your town/country and want to address and why? What impact do you hope make in the world? How have you collaborated together and used your STEM skills towards these goals?
	- In São Caetano do Sul and broader Brazil, sustainability challenges such as traffic congestion, pollution, and inefficient energy use are prominent. The Eco Mauá team aims to address these issues by developing highly efficient, sustainable vehicles. By collaborating with former team members, other student groups, and faculty at Instituto Mauá de Tecnologia, they have pooled their STEM skills and knowledge to create innovative solutions. The team's projects not only focus on immediate competition goals but also on broader applications that can contribute to reducing environmental impact and promoting sustainable transportation. They hope their work will inspire others and have a lasting positive impact on their community and beyond, demonstrating how collaborative efforts in STEM can lead to meaningful environmental change.
	
- *INNOVATION: What new innovative concept/solution or technology have you adopted to make your cars more energy efficient? Can it be explained in layman's terms?
	- To maximize our vehicle's efficiency after achieving a lower-than-expected result in the 2024 Shell Eco-marathon, we completely re-evaluated and redesigned the electrical system to enhance overall energy efficiency. For the 2025 competition, we've implemented an innovative chassis made entirely of carbon fiber tubes, a lightweight yet strong material, which we manufacture in-house to precisely meet our specific design requirements. Additionally, our vehicle features a newly designed steering mechanism controlled by levers instead of a traditional steering wheel, preventing the front wheels from becoming misaligned and improving overall handling. Another key innovation is an advanced motor coupling and decoupling system, allowing the electric motor to engage precisely when needed to accelerate and disengage seamlessly, enabling the vehicle to coast freely and reduce energy loss. These combined innovations reflect our team's ongoing commitment to optimizing performance through innovative engineering solutions.

- *LOOKING TO THE FUTURE: Does your team have aspirations to address any challenges for your country or globally, in terms of energy transition (cleaner energy), sustainability or a climate challenge with your STEM skills after graduation? If so how?
	- The Eco Mauá team is committed to addressing energy transition challenges and promoting sustainability through their work. After graduation, team members aspire to continue developing technologies that support cleaner energy and more sustainable practices. They plan to leverage their experience from the Shell Eco-marathon to tackle broader climate challenges, such as improving the efficiency of electric vehicles, developing renewable energy sources, and reducing carbon emissions. By applying their STEM skills, they hope to contribute to a more sustainable future for Brazil and the world, driving forward the transition to cleaner energy and more efficient, eco-friendly transportation solutions.
