Team Stories
PERSERVERANCE:
The team faced significant challenges leading up to the Shell Eco-marathon, particularly because they had no prior experience building an Urban Concept vehicle from scratch. With less than one year to prepare for the 2025 Shell Eco-marathon Brazil, members had to rapidly acquire extensive knowledge in automotive mechanics and electrical systems. Despite being new to the competition and the additional complexities of an internal combustion engine (ICE), they successfully built a fully functional vehicle. The team prioritized simplicity and robustness to ensure the vehicle passed technical inspections and worked reliably. Through dedication, rapid learning, and collaboration with faculty, advisors, and peers, the team overcame these hurdles, demonstrating their resilience and ability to turn daunting challenges into achievements.

COLLABORATION:
In São Caetano do Sul and throughout Brazil, sustainability issues such as traffic congestion, pollution, and inefficient energy use are prominent. To tackle these challenges, the team is committed to creating practical, robust, and sustainable vehicles. By closely collaborating with faculty, other student groups, and advisors at their institution, they leveraged their developing STEM skills and rapidly acquired mechanical and electrical knowledge to address real-world issues through their Urban Concept vehicle project. The team hopes their collaborative efforts will inspire others, proving that even teams with limited initial experience can significantly contribute toward sustainable transportation solutions and positively impact their community and beyond.

INNOVATION:
To successfully build our Urban Concept vehicle from scratch for the 2025 Shell Eco-marathon Brazil, our team focused on simplicity and functionality, given our lack of prior experience and the tight timeframe. We chose straightforward yet robust design solutions, prioritizing reliability over immediate maximum efficiency. The vehicle incorporates an internal combustion engine (ICE), a new and challenging technology for our team. To enhance reliability, we carefully simplified the vehicle's systems, ensuring they would pass rigorous technical inspections. Although efficiency improvements will be a future focus, our current innovations lie in creating a solid foundation and robust mechanical and electrical systems that can serve as a platform for continuous improvement in upcoming competitions.

LOOKING TO THE FUTURE:
Our team is dedicated to addressing energy transition challenges and advancing sustainability through ongoing innovation. After graduation, members aspire to leverage their hands-on experience gained from constructing an Urban Concept vehicle to pursue projects promoting cleaner energy, sustainable transportation, and reduced carbon emissions. They aim to apply their newfound STEM knowledge to tackle climate and energy challenges at both local and global levels, particularly by refining ICE and electric vehicle technologies and supporting renewable energy initiatives. Ultimately, the team is driven by the goal of contributing to a more sustainable future in Brazil and globally, using their experience as a stepping stone to more ambitious environmental solutions.
