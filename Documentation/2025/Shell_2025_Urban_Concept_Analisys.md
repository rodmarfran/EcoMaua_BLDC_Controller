...

# General

## Energy Compartment

- Design the energy compartment (engine, transmission, and battery) for easy inspection access.  
- Use protective grommets for cables passing through the bulkhead and seal openings with fire-resistant material.

## Emergency Shutdown and Safety Features

- Install an **internal emergency shutdown switch** accessible to the driver in the seated position.  
- Install an **external emergency shutdown button** at the rear of the vehicle with a latching red button that resets by rotation.  
- Include a **dead man’s safety device** to stop propulsion if the driver is incapacitated.

## Documentation and Technical Inspections

- Prepare a detailed **block diagram** of the energy and propulsion systems.  
- Maintain documentation for all key components, especially the battery and BMS, for technical inspection.

## Testing and Validation

- Test all safety systems, including emergency shutdown, dead man’s switch, lighting, and braking.  
- Validate compliance with wet weather readiness and weight/dimension requirements before technical inspection.

# Electrical

## Lighting System

- Install the following lights, ensuring compliance with color requirements:
	- **Front headlights**: Standard white.  
	- **Front and rear turn indicators**: Amber/yellow.  
	- **Rear brake lights and running lights**: Red.  
- Lights must be at least **25 mm** in height or width and positioned symmetrically.  
- Include a **hazard light function**.

## Lighting Control Buttons

- **Button Layout**:
	- Group related controls (e.g., headlights, turn indicators, hazard lights) together.  
	- Use a horizontal row or circular layout on the dashboard near the steering wheel for easy reach.  
- **Button Size**:
	- Ensure buttons are large enough for easy operation, even with gloves (15–20 mm diameter).  
	- Space buttons at least 10 mm apart to prevent accidental presses.  
- **Markings and Labels**:
	- Use clear and durable labels or icons for each button.  
	- Ensure labels are illuminated or glow in the dark for night use.  
- **Button Types**:
	- Push buttons for toggling (e.g., hazard lights).  
	- Rocker or toggle switches for headlights and running lights.  
- **Color Coding**:
	- **Red** for hazard lights, **green** for turn indicators, **blue** for high beams, and **white/yellow** for standard lights.  
- **Placement**:
	- Ensure buttons are within **30 cm reach** of the driver’s seated position.  
	- Avoid positions requiring the driver to remove both hands from the steering wheel.  
- **Tactile Feedback**:
	- Use buttons with a physical click or resistance for confirmation without looking.  
- **Backlighting**:
	- Add soft backlighting to buttons for visibility in low-light conditions.

## Battery System

- Use a single battery with a maximum voltage of **60V**.  
- Mount the battery outside the driver’s compartment, behind the bulkhead.  
- For lithium batteries:
	- Use a **Battery Management System (BMS)** to monitor safety conditions.
	- House the battery in a fire-resistant tray or charging bag.  
	- Provide documentation for the battery and BMS during inspection.  
- Include **short-circuit protection** near the positive terminal.

## Joulemeter Installation

- Place the joulemeter between the battery and electrical system to measure energy usage.  
- Connect the **starter motor cable** after the joulemeter but before the main vehicle fuse, ensuring starter energy is measured.  
- Ensure it’s visible and accessible for inspection.

## Telemetry and Sensors

- Install the telemetry system provided by the organizers, ensuring proper placement and clear antenna visibility.  
- Perform a telemetry self-check to ensure no electrical noise interferes with telemetry operation.

## Starter Motor Requirements

- Use an **electric starter motor** (manual starting is not allowed).  
- Ensure it is configured to prevent providing forward propulsion.

## Wiring and Enclosures

- Secure wiring neatly and away from moving parts.  
- Ensure all wiring connections are accessible and avoid splices.  
- Use **transparent covers** for electrical enclosures, or enclosures with transparent construction.  
- Label all fuses clearly in technical drawings and ensure they are easy to access.  

## Short-Circuit and Overload Protection

- Equip all batteries and supercapacitors with **short-circuit protection** near the positive terminal.  
- Include **overload protection** (fuses or current-limiting devices) in all circuits.

## Accessory Battery Use

- The accessory battery may power:  
	- Safety devices (e.g., lights, wipers, ignition systems).  
	- Electrically driven components like cooling pumps or compressors.  

## Wet Weather Resilience

- Ensure the vehicle’s electrical system is designed to operate safely in wet weather conditions without malfunction.

# Mechanical

## Driver Compartment and Safety

- Ensure the driver’s compartment has a **minimum height of 880 mm** and a **width of 700 mm at the shoulders**.  
- Design the vehicle with **two doors**, one on each side, with an opening of at least **500 x 800 mm**.  
- Include a **fixed roof** over the driver’s compartment.  

## Weight and Dimensions

- Keep the vehicle’s weight (excluding the driver) under **225 kg**.  
- Design dimensions:  
	- Height: **1000 mm to 1300 mm**.  
	- Width (excluding mirrors): **1200 mm to 1300 mm**.  
	- Length: **2200 mm to 3500 mm**.  
- Ensure the track width is at least **1000 mm** (front axle) and **800 mm** (rear axle).

## Braking System

- Install a **four-disc hydraulic braking system** with discs at least **3 mm thick** (bicycle brakes are not allowed).  
- Test the braking system to ensure it holds the vehicle stationary on a **20% incline**.

## Wheels and Tyres

- Use rims **14 to 18 inches in diameter**.  
- Ensure tyre width is at least **80 mm**, measured with the tyre inflated at operating pressure.  
- Maintain at least **1 mm tread depth** and ensure tyres fit recommended rims.

## Exhaust System

- Build the exhaust system to direct gases outside the vehicle while ensuring it withstands high temperatures without leaks.  

## Towing Hook

- Equip the front of the vehicle with a **towing hook or ring** capable of towing the vehicle’s weight in case of a breakdown.  

## Wet Weather Readiness

- Add an **electric windshield wiper** controlled by a switch accessible to the driver.  
- Ventilate the vehicle to prevent fogging in wet conditions.
